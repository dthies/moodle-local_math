moodle-local_math
=================

This plugin provides a backend framework for constructing mathematics
filters in Moodle.  Plugins handle changing mathematics scripts into
images of code snippets. The images or code are then automatically cached
and served when refenced in an image tag. A separate filter plugin is
required to find scripts in a page and insert the appropriate image tags.
